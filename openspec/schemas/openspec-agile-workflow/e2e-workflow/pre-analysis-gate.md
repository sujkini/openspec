# Pre-Analysis Gate — ADR/PR Scoping & Approval

## Purpose

This rule produces a lean, scannable analysis document from an ADR or PR. The user reviews and approves (or modifies) this document **before** full test plan generation begins. This prevents wasted effort on misaligned test plans.

**Workflow:** User provides ADR/PR → **this rule generates pre-analysis** → user approves → auto-triggers `test-plan-e2e-generation` with the approved scope as input.

---

## 1. Input Handling

This rule supports the same input modes as `test-plan-e2e-generation`:

| Input provided | Mode |
| --- | --- |
| ADR only | ADR Mode |
| ADR + PR | ADR+PR Mode (PR enriches) |
| PR only | PR Mode |
| PR + Repo link | PR Mode (repo enriches) |
| Neither | STOP — ask for ADR or PR |

### How to fetch inputs

**PR:**
```bash
# PR metadata and diff
gh pr view <PR-NUMBER> --repo <org/repo> --json title,body,state,labels,files,additions,deletions,changedFiles
gh pr diff <PR-NUMBER> --repo <org/repo>

# Review comments — captures unresolved discussions, reviewer concerns, and context not in the diff
gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/pulls/<PR-NUMBER>/comments
gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/pulls/<PR-NUMBER>/reviews
```

**Review comments are mandatory input.** Unresolved reviewer concerns (e.g., "should this use runAsUser:65532?", "what about HostIPC?") often reveal scope gaps, contested design decisions, or incomplete implementation. Surface these in the analysis — either as regression risks, exclusions with justification, or items flagged for user clarification.

**ADR:** Accept Google Docs URL, GitHub file URL, local path, or pasted markdown. If fetch fails, ask the user to paste it.

### Stop condition

- No ADR and no PR → **STOP**, ask for input.
- Jira alone is not sufficient → **STOP**, ask for ADR or PR.

---

## 2. Change Type Classification

**Do this FIRST. It drives everything downstream.**

Classify the change into one of these categories based on the PR description/diff or ADR goals:

| Change Type | Testing Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| **Feature** | E2E-heavy — new positive-path + negative-path tests |
| **Bug Fix** | Regression-focused — reproduce the bug, verify the fix, guard against recurrence |
| **Refactor** | Regression-only — existing behavior must not change, minimal new tests |
| **Config** | Deployment/upgrade tests — verify config propagation and rollback |
| **Security** | Negative-heavy — privilege escalation, RBAC boundaries, admission control |
| **CRD Change** | API contract tests — validation, defaulting, backward compatibility |

If the change spans multiple types, pick the dominant one and note secondary concerns.

---

## 3. Impact Analysis (Files Touched)

### PR Mode
List all changed files from the diff. Categorize each:

| Category | File Patterns | Test Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRD Types | `api/**/*_types.go` | Field validation, status, E2E |
| Controllers | `internal/controller/**` | Reconcile logic, INT + E2E |
| Webhooks | `*_webhook.go` | Admission, INT + negative E2E |
| RBAC | `config/rbac/**` | Security (least privilege) |
| Samples | `config/samples/**` | Become E2E test inputs |
| Tests | `*_test.go` | Understand existing patterns |
| Config | `config/manager/**`, `Dockerfile` | Deployment/upgrade |
| Other | Everything else | Assess individually |

**Output:** Total file count, breakdown by category, new vs. modified vs. deleted.

### ADR Mode
Infer affected file areas from components described in the ADR (CRDs, controllers, operands, APIs). Map each to the category table above.

---

## 4. Existing Test Coverage Assessment

**Before proposing new tests, check what's already covered.**

1. Identify `*_test.go` files in affected directories.
2. For each affected component, determine:
   - Which existing tests cover it (by name/description)?
   - What behaviors are already validated?
   - Which existing tests may need **updating** due to this change?
3. Summarize as:
   - **Already covered:** Components/behaviors with existing test coverage (no new tests needed).
   - **Partially covered:** Existing tests exist but don't cover the new/changed behavior.
   - **Not covered:** No existing tests — net-new tests required.
   - **Needs update:** Existing tests that will break or become stale due to this change.

---

## 5. Blast Radius

### When operator quality gates are available (MANDATORY)

**If `qe-e2e/qe-behaviour.md` exists in the operator repo (read in Step 0c of `/opsx-e2e`), you MUST use its Section 3a/3b before completing this section.** If not present, derive context from `agents.md` and `constitution.md`. Do not infer components or quality gates from the diff alone when operator context is available.

Apply these rules in order:

1. **Component checklist (Section 3b):** Use the operand/component list from the operator's quality gates as the blast-radius checklist. Mark **every** listed component as affected or not affected — do not omit any.
2. **Quality gates table (Section 3b):** Use the domain-specific quality gate categories from the operator's quality gates (e.g., Operator Lifecycle, Operand Health, Core Functionality, Security, Deployment Integration, Resilience) instead of the generic fallback table below.
3. **Deployment context (Section 3a):** Read the operator's deployment context and note deployment constraints (OLM/Helm/manual, namespace, operand CR naming, config patching method) that affect E2E feasibility or step wording. Include these in the output's "Operator Context (Embedded)" section.
4. **Gate → test accountability:** Every quality gate marked **Affected** in this section MUST appear in **either** Section 7 (Proposed Tests) **or** Section 8 (Exclusions) with a code-level justification. Do not mark a gate affected and leave it unaccounted for in both sections.

If no operator quality gates are available (no `qe-e2e/qe-behaviour.md` and no relevant context in `agents.md`), use the generic component and quality gate frameworks below.

### Components Affected

Identify all components, operands, or services in the project that could be affected by this change. Derive the list from the repository structure (CRDs, controllers, operands, managed workloads, APIs).

**When operator quality gates are available:** Start from the operator's Section 3b component/operand list and check every entry.

Format as a checklist:
```
- [ ] <Component A>
- [ ] <Component B>
- [ ] <Component C>
- [ ] Operator Core (deployment, subscription, RBAC)
```

### Quality Gates Impacted

**When operator quality gates are available:** Use the operator's Section 3b quality gate categories and observables — not the generic table below.

**Otherwise**, use the generic quality gate framework:

| Gate Category | Affected? | Specific Gates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operator/App Lifecycle | Yes/No | Installation, Health, Recovery |
| Component Health | Yes/No | Which components reach ready state |
| Core Functionality | Yes/No | The primary domain behavior (e.g., identity issuance, data processing, routing) |
| Security | Yes/No | RBAC, admission, privilege boundaries, secrets |
| Deployment Integration | Yes/No | OLM, Helm, GitOps upgrade conditions |
| Resilience | Yes/No | Recovery, config reconciliation, self-healing |

### Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level:** Low / Medium / High / Critical

| Factor | Value | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Components touched | N | More components = higher risk |
| CRD schema changes | Yes/No | Schema changes = High risk |
| RBAC/Security boundaries | Yes/No | Security changes = High risk |
| Breaking change potential | Yes/No | Breaking = Critical risk |
| Upgrade path affected | Yes/No | Upgrade impact = High risk |

### Dependency Map
- **Upstream:** What feeds into the changed components
- **Downstream:** What depends on the changed components — what else could break

---

## 6. Regression Risk Map

**What existing behavior could break?**

| Area | Existing Test(s) | Risk | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| e.g., Component readiness | `e2e_test.go:TestComponentReady` | Medium | Controller reconcile logic changed |

- List existing tests likely affected by this change.
- Flag behaviors that existing tests validate which might regress.
- Note API contracts that could break (field renames, type changes, removed defaults).

**Downstream tracing (mandatory):** For every quality gate marked as affected in the Blast Radius (Section 5), there MUST be a corresponding entry in this regression risk table — or an explicit "no risk because..." justification. Do not leave impacted quality gates unaccounted for.

**Cross-check against quality gates:** Use the operator quality gates (from `qe-e2e/qe-behaviour.md` Section 3b, or embedded in the output's Operator Context section) to validate completeness. For example, if Blast Radius says "Core Functionality: Yes" but the regression table has no entry for the affected core behaviors, the table is incomplete. If "Operator Lifecycle: Yes" but no installation/health/recovery entry, the table is incomplete.

**Specificity rule:** Every at-risk test must be referenced by its specific test name and file location (e.g., `e2e_test.go:"SPIRE Agent should be installed successfully"`). Search existing `*_test.go` files in affected directories for real test names — do not invent placeholder names. Never use "same test", "same E2E", "see above", or "multiple E2E contexts".

If no regression risk exists, state: **"No regression risk identified — change is additive."**

---

## 7. Proposed Test Cases (Preview)

**This is a lean preview — titles and one-liners only, not full test steps.**

Present in **priority order** (highest-value, highest-risk tests first):

| # | ID | Tier | Title | Description (one line) | Effort | Confidence | Maps To |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | E2E-001 | E2E | ... | ... | S/M/L | High/Med/Low | ADR §X or PR file:L42 |
| 2 | NEG-001 | NEG | ... | ... | S/M/L | High/Med/Low | ... |

**Priority ordering criteria:**
1. Critical risk + no existing coverage → top priority
2. High risk + partial coverage → high priority
3. New behavior (feature) → medium priority
4. Edge cases and exploratory → lower priority

**Gate coverage rule:** When operator quality gates are available, every quality gate marked **Affected** in Section 5 must have at least one proposed test in this section **unless** it is explicitly excluded in Section 8 with a code-level reason (e.g., function defined but not called from controllers).

**Operand coverage rule:** When a change touches multiple operand controllers, propose at least one E2E test per affected operand using the **primary resource type modified in the PR diff** for that controller (e.g., DaemonSet reconciler change → DaemonSet conflict test, not a tangential SA test).

**Tier discipline:** UT and INT tests cover utility functions and recorder contracts — they do not substitute for E2E tests of operator behavior in a live cluster. Propose UT/INT only for pure functions; keep operand/controller behavior in E2E/NEG tiers.

### Estimated Distribution

**Base budget:** 15–20 test cases for a single ADR/PR.

**Scaling rules:**
- **Multiple ADRs:** Multiply proportionally (2 ADRs → 30–40 initial budget)
- **Complex ADR** (5+ "How" sections or 3+ configuration variants): Scale to 25–30
- **Config override:** If `config.yaml` has `qe.max_test_cases_initial`, use that value as the budget
- The consolidation stage (Stage 3) compresses to the hard limit (`max_test_cases`)

| Tier | Proposed Count | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E2E | 6–8 | Primary focus — user-facing scenarios |
| NEG | 3–4 | Operator resilience under destructive conditions |
| ERR | 3–5 | Error path + recovery pairs (from Section 7a) |
| MQE | 2–3 | Acceptance + exploratory |
| INT | 2–3 | Only if reconciler/webhook interactions warrant it |
| UT | 2–3 | Only for new pure utility functions |
| NFT | 0–2 | Only if numeric thresholds/SLAs exist (from Section 7d) |
| **Total** | **15–20** (base) | Scale per rules above |

### Effort Estimate

| Effort Tag | Meaning | Approximate Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S** | Simple setup, single assertion | < 1 hour |
| **M** | Moderate setup, multiple assertions | 1–4 hours |
| **L** | Complex setup, multi-step scenario | 4+ hours |

**Total estimated effort range:** Sum of individual estimates.

### 7a. Error Path Extraction

For every conditional/branching path in the ADR "How" section or PR diff, systematically ask:

1. **Dependency failure:** What if the external dependency returns an error (API 404, timeout, auth failure, TLS handshake failure)?
2. **Invalid config:** What if user-provided configuration is invalid, missing, or malformed?
3. **Write failure:** What if the operator cannot write to a managed resource (RBAC denied, resource conflict, resource not found)?
4. **Recovery:** For each error above — what is the recovery path? Does the operator self-heal when the condition is fixed?

Propose error + recovery test **pairs** (break it, fix it, verify recovery). These are distinct from NEG tests: NEG tests cover destructive resilience (pod deletion, config corruption); error path tests cover bad input/dependency recovery.

**Target:** 3–5 error/recovery pairs, scaling with ADR complexity.

| Error Scenario | Expected Behavior | Recovery | Proposed Test ID |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| e.g., Dependency API returns 404 | Operator retries with backoff, status condition shows error | Remove error condition → operator recovers | ERR-001 + ERR-002 |

### 7b. Variant Coverage Extraction

Does this feature define multiple modes, profiles, tiers, or configuration variants?

- If **yes:** list every variant from the ADR.
  - Propose at least one E2E per variant validating variant-specific behavior.
  - For mutually exclusive variants, propose at least one NEG test verifying the wrong variant is rejected.
- If **no:** state "No configuration variants identified."

| Variant | Type | Proposed E2E | Proposed NEG |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| e.g., Profile: Modern | Config mode | E2E-NNN | NEG-NNN (reject if wrong profile set) |

### 7c. Compliance Tooling Check

Does the ADR or PR mention verification, compliance, or auditing tools (scanners, validators, health checkers, CLI commands)?

- If **yes:** propose at least one E2E or MQE test that runs the tool and asserts expected output. This is distinct from functional testing — it validates auditor-provable compliance.
- If **no:** state "No compliance tooling identified in scope."

| Tool | What It Checks | Proposed Test |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| e.g., `oc adm inspect` | Operator health | MQE-NNN |

### 7d. Threshold and SLA Extraction

Extract every numeric threshold, SLA, or timing requirement from the ADR:

- Restart windows (e.g., "pod must restart within 60s")
- Latency targets (e.g., "response within 500ms")
- Resource limits (e.g., "memory < 256Mi")
- Recovery times (e.g., "self-heal within 5 minutes")
- FIPS/compliance timings

For each threshold, propose one NFT test. If the ADR uses vague language ("quickly", "fast", "promptly"), flag it for user confirmation with a suggested concrete threshold.

| Threshold | Value | Source | Proposed NFT |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| e.g., Pod restart time | 60s | ADR §Recovery | NFT-001 |
| e.g., "recovers quickly" | **VAGUE — suggest 120s?** | ADR §Resilience | NFT-002 (needs user confirmation) |

If no thresholds exist: state "No numeric thresholds or SLAs identified."

---

## 8. What Will NOT Be Tested (Intentional Exclusions)

**Explicitly list what is out of scope and why.**

- Items from ADR Non-Goals section
- Components/files unchanged by the PR
- Behaviors already fully covered by existing tests (from Section 4)
- Areas explicitly excluded by the user

**Code-path verification (mandatory before excluding OR proposing update-path / Day-2 behavior):**

Before proposing tests for update-path, Day-2, or label-removal scenarios — or before excluding them — search the changed controller code to confirm the code path is actually invoked:

```
# Example: verify a utility is called from controllers (not just defined)
rg "FunctionName" pkg/controller/ --glob '*.go' --glob '!*_test.go'
```

- If a function is **defined but not called** from production controller code → exclude the behavior as speculative and cite the grep result.
- If PR description claims Day-2 behavior but the diff only adds create-path handling → exclude Day-2 and note the gap between description and implementation.

Format:
```
- <Excluded item> — Reason: <why it's excluded> (code evidence: <file or grep result>)
```

If the user does not see something they expected here, they should flag it before approval.

**Multi-cluster / federation awareness:** Does the ADR mention cross-cluster behavior (federation, replication, mirroring, multi-site, multi-cluster)? If yes:
- **Do NOT silently exclude.** Propose tests with an explicit `Infrastructure: multi-cluster` tag.
- Only exclude if the user confirms no multi-cluster lab is available.
- Surface as: "Proposed but requires multi-cluster lab — confirm availability or exclude explicitly."
- Format: `- <test title> — Infrastructure: multi-cluster — <what it tests>`

## 9. Analysis Confidence Score

Rate the overall confidence of this analysis:

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **High** | ADR available, clear scope, components well-understood |
| **Medium** | PR-only mode, most behaviors inferable from diff |
| **Low** | PR-only with complex/ambiguous changes, design intent unclear |

**Per-section confidence** (where relevant):
- Impact Analysis: High/Medium/Low
- Blast Radius: High/Medium/Low
- Proposed Tests: High/Medium/Low

**What would increase confidence:**
- e.g., "Provide the ADR for full design context"
- e.g., "Clarify whether field X is backward-compatible"

## ACTION REQUIRED

Review this analysis and respond with one of:
- **Approved** — proceeds to full test plan generation automatically
- **Approved with changes** — specify modifications (add/remove/reorder tests, adjust scope)
- **Rejected** — specify what needs rework

_Once approved, this document becomes the scoping input for test plan generation. The test plan will respect the approved scope, priority ordering, and exclusions._
```

---

## 12. Approval Gate & Auto-Trigger Handoff

### Before approval
- Present the analysis document to the user.
- **STOP. Do not proceed to test plan generation.**
- Wait for the user to respond with Approved, Approved with changes, or Rejected.

### On "Approved with changes"
- Apply the user's modifications to the analysis document.
- Re-present the updated document for final confirmation.

### On "Approved"
1. Save the final approved analysis as `e2e-analysis.md` in the working directory.
2. **Automatically proceed to full test plan generation** using the rules in `test-plan-generation.md`.
3. The test plan generator reads `e2e-analysis.md` as its scoping input. It **MUST**:
   - Use the approved proposed test cases as the starting skeleton.
   - Respect the approved priority ordering.
   - Respect the approved exclusions — do not generate tests for excluded items.
   - Expand each proposed test case into full test steps (preconditions, steps, expected outcomes, cleanup).
   - Stay within the approved tier distribution (may adjust ±1 per tier if justified).
   - Reference the pre-analysis file in the test plan header.

### On "Rejected"
- Ask what needs rework.
- Re-run the analysis with the user's feedback incorporated.
