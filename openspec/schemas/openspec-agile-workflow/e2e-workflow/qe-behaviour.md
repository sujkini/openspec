# QE Behavioral Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM mistakes in QE workflows. Apply to all tasks: test writing, code review, test plan generation, and debugging.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward precision and traceability over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Ask Before Assuming

**Don't invent requirements. Surface confusion early.**

- If the ADR or PR diff is ambiguous, ask — don't fabricate requirements.
- If multiple test approaches exist, present options — don't pick silently.
- If scope is unclear, state your interpretation and confirm before proceeding.
- If something contradicts the ADR, stop and flag the conflict.
- In PR Mode, if design intent is unclear from code alone, flag it as a gap.

## 2. Precision Over Volume

**One test per observable behavior. No padding.**

- Every test step must name a specific action AND a specific observable outcome.
- Never use vague verbs ("verify", "ensure", "check") without a named observable (e.g. condition `Ready=True`, HTTP 200, specific field value).
- Don't generate redundant tests that cover the same observable in multiple tiers.
- If you write 10 tests and 5 cover the same behavior, consolidate to 5.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior QE engineer say these are redundant?" If yes, deduplicate.

## 3. Surgical Scope

**Test only what the change covers. Nothing speculative.**

- Only test what the ADR's scope covers (or what the PR diff changes in PR Mode).
- Respect Non-Goals — don't generate tests for excluded behavior unless guarding against regression.
- Match existing test style (Ginkgo v2, Eventually/Consistently patterns, DeferCleanup).
- Never inline K8s resource specs (Pod, Deployment, etc.) in test files — use or create a builder helper in `test/e2e/utils/`. Duplicated specs drift silently (e.g. missing SecurityContext, wrong image).
- Before adding a DeferCleanup, check if the setup helper (e.g. `SetupAttestationTest`) already registers cleanup for that resource. Don't revert a field on a resource that will be deleted entirely by the helper's cleanup — the revert is redundant.
- Never hardcode time durations (timeouts, polling intervals) in test files — use constants from `test/e2e/utils/constants.go` (e.g. `DefaultTimeout`, `ShortTimeout`, `DefaultInterval`, `ShortInterval`). If no suitable constant exists, add one to `constants.go` first.
- Don't refactor existing tests unless asked.

**Validation:** Every test case should trace directly to the ADR's stated goals/risks or the PR's changed behaviors.

## 3a. Operator Deployment Context (OLM-Managed)

**The ZTWIM operator is installed and managed via OLM (Operator Lifecycle Manager). Never assume direct deployment control.**

- The operator is deployed via a **ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)**, not a standalone Deployment.
- **Never use `oc scale deployment`** to change replica count — OLM will immediately revert it. Use CSV patch instead:
  ```
  oc patch csv <csv-name> -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager \
    --type=json -p '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/install/spec/deployments/0/spec/replicas","value":N}]'
  ```
- **Never use `oc edit deployment`** to change container args/env — patch the CSV or Subscription instead.
- To add environment variables (e.g., `CREATE_ONLY_MODE`), patch the **Subscription**:
  ```
  oc patch subscription openshift-zero-trust-workload-identity-manager \
    -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager --type='merge' \
    -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"ENV_VAR","value":"value"}]}}}'
  ```
- Operator namespace: `zero-trust-workload-identity-manager`
- CSV name pattern: `zero-trust-workload-identity-manager.v<VERSION>`
- Operand CRs: SpireServer, SpireAgent, SpiffeCSIDriver, SpireOIDCDiscoveryProvider, ZeroTrustWorkloadIdentityManager
- All operands use the name `cluster` (e.g., `oc get spireagent cluster`)
- When writing test steps involving scaling, env changes, or operator config, always use the OLM-appropriate method (CSV/Subscription patch), not direct deployment manipulation.

## 3b. ZTWIM Quality Gates (Domain-Specific)

**Critical quality gates that tests must cover for the ZTWIM operator. Use these to validate test coverage.**

### Operator Lifecycle
| Gate | Observable |
|------|------------|
| Installation | CSV phase = `Succeeded`, all CRDs `Established=True` |
| Operator Health | Deployment `Available=True`, pod `Running` |
| Recovery | New pod `Running` within 60s after deletion |

### Operand Health (All Must Be Ready)
| Operand | Observable |
|---------|------------|
| SpireServer | `Ready=True` condition, StatefulSet pods `1/1` |
| SpireAgent | `Ready=True` condition, DaemonSet on all nodes |
| SpiffeCSIDriver | `Ready=True` condition, CSIDriver registered |
| SpireOIDCDiscoveryProvider | `Ready=True` condition, Route accessible |
| ZeroTrustWorkloadIdentityManager | `OperandsAvailable=True`, `Ready=True` |

### Identity & Attestation (SPIFFE/SPIRE Core)
| Gate | Observable |
|------|------------|
| SVID Issuance | `svid.pem` exists with valid X.509 certificate |
| SPIFFE ID Format | URI SAN = `spiffe://<trustDomain>/ns/<ns>/sa/<sa>` |
| Bundle Distribution | `bundle.pem` contains CA certificates |
| Certificate Chain | `cert.Verify()` succeeds against bundle |
| SVID Rotation | Serial number changes before TTL expiry |

### Security
| Gate | Observable |
|------|------------|
| UID/GID Compliance | spire-agent: RunAsAny (UID determined by image default), non-root recommended; GID within namespace range |
| SCC Applied | Pod annotation shows correct SCC |
| RBAC Minimal | ClusterRole has no wildcard permissions |

### OLM Integration
| Gate | Observable |
|------|------------|
| Upgradeable=True | When all operands healthy |
| Upgradeable=False | When any operand fails or CreateOnlyMode enabled |
| CreateOnlyMode | Condition reflects `CREATE_ONLY_MODE` env var |

### Resilience
| Gate | Observable |
|------|------------|
| Server Recovery | StatefulSet pod recreated, `Ready=True` after deletion |
| Agent Recovery | DaemonSet pod recreated on node after deletion |
| Config Reconciliation | Operator restores modified ConfigMaps/Secrets |
| Multi-Failure Recovery | All operands recover to `Ready=True` |

**When writing tests:** Ensure critical gates (Operator Lifecycle, Operand Health, SVID Issuance) are covered. For feature PRs, map new functionality to relevant gates.

## 4. Traceability Always

**Every test traces back to a source. No orphan tests.**

- In ADR Mode: every test traces to an ADR section or Jira acceptance criteria.
- In PR Mode: every test traces to a specific diff location (`file.go:L42`) or PR description.
- Never trace to commits or unrelated PRs.
- Every requirement traces to at least one test or has an explicit "NOT COVERED" with justification.
- Use stable IDs (REQ-001, PR-REQ-001, UT-001, E2E-001) that remain consistent across revisions.

## 5. Self-Verify Before Outputting

**Define success criteria. Loop until they pass.**

- Run quality gates before returning any test plan.
- If a gate fails, fix and re-verify — don't output a failing plan.
- Count coverage by tier and priority before finishing.
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with verification checkpoints:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

## Stop Conditions (non-negotiable)

- No ADR and no PR provided → STOP, ask for ADR or PR link
- ADR has no "How" section → WARN user, generate with reduced Tier 1/2 coverage
- Jira conflicts with ADR → Document conflict, follow ADR, ask user to resolve
- More than 3 ambiguous requirements → STOP, list ambiguities, ask for clarification
- PR-only mode: more than 3 low-confidence requirements → WARN user, recommend ADR review

## Good vs Bad Examples

```
BAD step:  "Verify the operator works correctly"
GOOD step: "Assert status condition Ready=True on SpireServer CR within 60s"

BAD step:  "Check security"
GOOD step: "Exec into spire-server pod; confirm process runs as UID 1000 (non-root)"

BAD step:  "Ensure cleanup happens"
GOOD step: "Delete SpireServer CR; assert finalizer removes spire-agent DaemonSet within 30s"
```

---

**These guidelines are working if:** test plans have zero vague steps, every test traces to a requirement, no redundant tests exist across tiers, and clarifying questions come before generation rather than after mistakes.
