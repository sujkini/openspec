description: Implement tasks via OAPE command orchestration (one task per invocation, state machine driven)
---

Implement an OpenSpec change using OAPE commands. **ONE task per invocation.**
State-machine driven with externalized state at `implementation/state.yaml`.

**Per-task flow:** OAPE → verify → tests → eval gate → refine → present → YIELD → wait for next invocation.

**Reference:** schema `oape_routing`, `code_generation_eval_gate`, `{schema_root}/stage-gate/CODE_GENERATION_EVAL_PROMPT.md`

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name (e.g., `/opsx:apply cm-830`). If omitted, infer from context or prompt.

## Architecture: State Machine

```
States: IDLE → EXECUTING_TASK → RUNNING_TESTS → EVAL_GATE → AWAITING_APPROVAL → IDLE → ... → COMPLETE
```

The orchestrator reads state, executes ONE task, writes state, and YIELDS.
It NEVER advances to the next task within the same response.

## State File

Location: `openspec/changes/<name>/implementation/state.yaml`
Template: `{schema_root}/templates/implementation-state-template.yaml`

Initialize from template on first invocation if missing.

## HARD RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE

1. **Read `state.yaml` FIRST** — before any other action, every single invocation
2. **ONE task per invocation** — you MUST NOT execute more than one task in a single response. When you finish presenting a task for approval, your response is DONE. Period.
3. **YIELD = END YOUR RESPONSE** — after the approval question, you MUST stop generating text. Do not read the next task. Do not compose the next design bundle. Do not think about what comes next. YOUR RESPONSE ENDS.
4. **On user "approve"** — write task report, mark complete, update state to IDLE, then STOP. Tell the user to run `/opsx-apply` again. Do NOT start the next task.
5. **Context windowing** — only load §4 payload for `current_task_id`, not all tasks
6. **Write state after every transition** — state must survive agent crashes

## YIELD BOUNDARY — CRITICAL

When you reach the approval question, you have TWO possible next actions:
- If user has NOT yet responded → END YOUR RESPONSE after the question
- If user says "approve" → write report, mark done, say "Run `/opsx-apply` for next task", then END YOUR RESPONSE
- If user says "reject" → re-run THIS task only (not the next one)

**WHAT YIELD MEANS:** You literally stop generating output. No "let me also...", no "now moving to...", no "next up...". The response terminates. The user must send a NEW message or re-invoke `/opsx-apply` to trigger the next task.

**WHY:** Without YIELD, you will batch tasks together. This destroys the per-task approval flow. The user MUST be able to review each task's code in isolation before the next one starts.

## Steps

### 1. Read state

Read `openspec/changes/<name>/implementation/state.yaml`.
If file doesn't exist, initialize from template.

### 2. Handle current state

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `IDLE` | Pick next pending task → go to step 3 |
| `AWAITING_APPROVAL` | Read user response (approve/reject) → handle |
| `COMPLETE` | Announce done, suggest `/opsx-archive` → STOP |
| `EXECUTING_TASK` | Resume from crash — re-run current task |

**On approve** (from AWAITING_APPROVAL):
- Write `implementation/task-reports/<task-id>.md`
- Mark task `- [x]` in tasks.md
- Move `current_task_result` to `completed[]`
- Clear `current_task_result` and `rejections`
- **Telemetry — signal task complete** (silent, non-blocking):
  ```bash
  python -m openspec.telemetry.auto on-task-complete --change "<name>" --task-id "<TASK_ID>" --status passed
  ```
- Set state: `IDLE`
- Check if all tasks done → set `COMPLETE` if yes
- Output EXACTLY: "✓ Task {id} approved. Report written. State: IDLE.\n\nRun `/opsx-apply` to execute the next task."
- **>>> STOP. END RESPONSE. DO NOT CONTINUE. <<<**

**On reject** (from AWAITING_APPROVAL):
- Append feedback to `rejections[]`
- Set state: `EXECUTING_TASK`
- Add REVISION FEEDBACK to design-bundle
- Continue to step 3 (re-execute current task)

### 3. Select change and verify (first invocation only)

On first run (no state.yaml):
1. Select change (`openspec list --json` if name not given)
2. `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
3. Verify prerequisites: OAPE commands, artifacts, gh/go/git/make
4. Fork setup: read `inputs/jira.yaml`, clone fork, create feature branch
5. Create `implementation/` and `task-reports/` dirs
6. Parse tasks.md §2 order, set `total_tasks`
7. Initialize `state.yaml` with state: IDLE
8. **Telemetry — signal apply start / phase 5** (silent, non-blocking):
   ```bash
   python -m openspec.telemetry.auto on-apply-start --change "<name>"
   ```
9. Pick first pending task → continue to step 4

### 4. Execute ONE task

**Context windowing**: Read ONLY the §4 payload for `current_task_id` from tasks.md.
Do NOT read payloads for other tasks.

Set state: `EXECUTING_TASK`. Write state.yaml.

**Telemetry — signal task start** (silent, non-blocking):
```bash
python -m openspec.telemetry.auto on-task-start --change "<name>" --task-id "<TASK_ID>" --agent "<AGENT_ID>" --title "<task_title>"
```

#### 4a. Compose design bundle

Write `implementation/design-bundle.md`:
- constitution, specs, plan, repo-assessment excerpts
- §4 payload **ONLY for current Task ID**
- REVISION FEEDBACK if retrying after rejection

#### 4b. Run OAPE command (exactly one)

1. **IF e2e task** → `/oape:e2e-generate <fork-default-branch>`
2. **ELIF** `API_Agent` verification-only → `/oape:api-generate-tests <api-path>`
3. **ELIF** `API_Agent` → `/oape:api-generate --design-doc <bundle>` + `make update && make verify`
4. **ELIF** `OperatorController_Agent` → `/oape:api-implement --design-doc <bundle>`
5. **ELIF** manual agent → implement task payload directly

#### 4c. Verify and test

Set state: `RUNNING_TESTS`. Write state.yaml.

Run Makefile targets from this task's Acceptance criteria.
- Controller tasks: co-generate `_test.go` → `go test`
- API tasks: `go build` + `go vet`
- E2E tasks: `go build`

#### 4d. Code eval gate

Set state: `EVAL_GATE`. Write state.yaml.

Read and follow **`{schema_root}/stage-gate/CODE_GENERATION_EVAL_PROMPT.md`** Steps 1–7 exactly.
This is the single source of truth for per-task code eval scoring, verification, test execution,
refinement, and result recording. Key paths used by the prompt:
- Eval cases: `{schema_root}/evals/code-generation_eval.yaml` (filter by oape_command)
- Eval results output: `openspec/changes/<name>/eval-results/code-generation-<task-id>.yaml`
- Task report template: `{schema_root}/templates/implementation-task-report-template.md`
- Max refinement passes: 2

#### 4e. Write result

Write `current_task_result` to state.yaml:
```yaml
current_task_result:
  task_id: <id>
  oape_command: <command>
  files_changed: [...]
  verification_pass: true/false
  test_command: "..."
  test_result: PASS/FAIL
  test_output_summary: "..."
  eval_score: <N>
  eval_cases_pass: <N>
  eval_cases_total: <N>
  refinement_rounds: <N>
```

### 5. Present and YIELD

Set state: `AWAITING_APPROVAL`. Write state.yaml.

Present task summary:
```
## Task: <TASK_ID> — <title>
Phase: <phase> | Task <index>/<total>

### OAPE Commands Executed
| Command | Args | Outcome |

### Files Changed
- path/to/file — brief description

### Test Results
| Test | Command | Result |

### Code Eval Scorecard
Score: N% (pass/total cases) | Refinement rounds: N

### Deviations (if any)
```

ASK: **"Code eval score: {N}% ({pass}/{total} cases pass). Approve the code changes for task {task_id} ({task_title})? (Approve / Reject with feedback)"**

**╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗**
**║  >>> YIELD — STOP GENERATING. END YOUR RESPONSE NOW. <<<   ║**
**║  Do NOT read the next task. Do NOT compose another bundle.  ║**
**║  Do NOT continue with any other action.                     ║**
**║  The user must send a new message to proceed.               ║**
**╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝**

### 6. Post-loop (state = COMPLETE)

When all tasks are marked complete:
- **Telemetry — signal apply complete** (silent, non-blocking):
  ```bash
  python -m openspec.telemetry.auto on-apply-complete --change "<name>"
  ```
- Write `implementation-report.md` aggregating all `task-reports/*.md`
- Write `deviation-observed.md` if any deviations logged
- Commit, push feature branch, open draft PR
- Present final summary with PR URL
- Set state: `COMPLETE`. Write state.yaml.

## Guardrails

- **Read state.yaml FIRST** — every invocation, no exceptions
- **ONE task per response** — NEVER implement two tasks in one invocation, even if the user approves inline
- **YIELD after approval question** — HARD STOP. End your response. No exceptions.
- **YIELD after processing approval** — write report, say "run /opsx-apply", then HARD STOP. Do NOT start next task.
- **Context windowing** — only §4 for current task, never load all task payloads
- **Write state on every transition** — crash recovery
- **Mandatory test execution** — never skip verification or tests
- **Never advance without a fresh invocation** — even if user says "approve", you stop after recording it
- On reject: re-run current task only (full loop)
- One OAPE command per task; OAPE in fork/working-folder cwd only

## Anti-Batching Contract

You are PROHIBITED from:
- Executing task N+1 in the same response where task N was approved
- Reading §4 payload for any task other than current_task_id
- Composing a design bundle for the next task after an approval
- Writing "now moving to..." or "let me start the next task..."
- Any action that advances the workflow after presenting an approval question or processing an approval

If you find yourself about to start a new task in the same response — STOP. You are violating the contract.
